# Clean-and-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys

In this project, we perform data cleaning tasks using Python and it's functions. Starting from data exploration, combining columns, dropping columns, handling missing values, we've done them all. Numpy, matplotlib libraries were used. Various other built-in python functions were implemented in the code.
